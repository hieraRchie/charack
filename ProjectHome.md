Charack is a tool able to generate pseudo-infinite virtual worlds with different types of terrain for 3D games. Using a combination of algorithms and content management methods, such as Perlin noise, the tool is able to create beaches, islands, bays and coastlines that imitate the real world landscapes. The tool handles separately the generation of content for all elements in the world (continents, terrains, etc.), so each one can be customized independently.
